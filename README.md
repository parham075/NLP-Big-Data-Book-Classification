# NLP-Big-Data-Book-Classification

A large-scale Natural Language Processing (NLP) project was undertaken within the domain of Big Data, leveraging Microsoft Azure Databricks. The primary objective was to process and analyze summaries of various books sourced from diverse endpoints, notably including [https://www.goodreads.com](https://www.goodreads.com), utilizing web scraping techniques facilitated by the selenium library.

To enhance the efficiency of the scraping process, the project module was containerized using Docker and deployed onto a server infrastructure. This strategic move significantly accelerated the data retrieval process, enabling seamless extraction and ingestion of book summaries from multiple sources.

In parallel, an NLP initiative was spearheaded by myself and collaborator [@shkhaksar](https://github.com/shkhaksar). This endeavor focused on developing a robust classification system capable of categorizing book descriptions into distinct genres such as fiction, comedy, and more. Through a combination of advanced NLP methodologies and machine learning algorithms, we engineered a solution that effectively categorizes book summaries based on their thematic content, thereby facilitating streamlined organization and analysis of literary datasets.
